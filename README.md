# MST Algorithms Comparison

## Project Description
This project compares Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for finding Minimum Spanning Trees in graphs.

## Test Results
- Both algorithms work correctly
- Kruskal is faster than Prim
- All tests pass successfully

## Files
- Main.java - main program
- Prim.java - Prim's algorithm
- Kruskal.java - Kruskal's algorithm
- Graph.java - graph structure
- Edge.java - edge class
- JSON files - test data
- CSV file - performance results

## Conclusion
Kruskal algorithm is recommended for most cases.
